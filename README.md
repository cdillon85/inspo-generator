##Inspo-Generator

 The Inspo-Generator provides beautiful landscape images and inspirational readings customized to your time limitations and current mood. It’s the perfect addition to a morning routine or any time an inspirational “pick-me-up” is needed. It was built over ~30 hours as a Fullstack Academy Stack-a-thon project.

Inspo-Generator was built using:
*React
*Redux
*React-Redux
*Node
*Express
*PostgreSQL
*Sequelize
*jQuery
*HTML
*CSS

The UI animations were achieved using a combination of CSS transitions and the ReactCSSTransitionGroup add-on component. The highlight and share feature is selection-sharer (https://github.com/xdamman/selection-sharer).

Quotes are from the public domain. Longer readings are from a selection of books I have found inspirational.

Future add-ons:
*Ability to share to Facebook
*Admin form for adding new inspirational quotes and readings via the web (instead of seed just file)
*User profiles to keep track of favorite quotes/readings and other personalization.
